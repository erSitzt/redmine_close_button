# Redmine Close Issue Button Plugin

This plugin adds the **Close** button to the issue toolbar in Redmine.

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with Redmine 5.x
I did not check with older versions, just updated one line to make it work with 5.x

## Installation

*These installation instructions are based on Redmine 2.6.0. For instructions for previous versions, see [Redmine wiki](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins).*

1. To install the plugin
    * Download the .ZIP archive, extract files and copy the plugin directory into *#{REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins*.
    
    Or

    * Change you current directory to your Redmine root directory:  

            cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
 
      Copy the plugin from GitHub using the following command:

            git clone https://github.com/Undev/redmine_close_button.git plugins/redmine_close_button

2. Update the Gemfile.lock file by running the following commands:  

         rm Gemfile.lock  
         bundle install

3. Restart Redmine.

Now you should be able to see the plugin in **Administration > Plugins**.
 
## Usage

This plugin adds the **Close** button to the issue toolbar in Redmine. The **Close** button is displayed if the following conditions are met:

* A user is allowed to close the issue.
* The issue is neither closed nor rejected.

To close the issue, click the **Close** button on the issue toolbar.

This will change the issue status to **Closed** and its progress to **100%**.
